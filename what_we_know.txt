possible Strategies
--------------------
content-based: finding similiar (based on title, text, keywords(?)) articles to the one the user just read (or read in past)

collaborative: finding users with similiar behavior (who read same article(s)), recommend items they liked (nearest neighbor)
	- build user-item-matrix
	- Pearson
	
What I found out about the example data so far -> see folder MatlabStuff

- 2626 item IDs 	-> only 69 with info about content
- 20854 user IDs
- very few articles that have been read outrageously much -> many articles that have only been read < 5 times
- average number of articles a user has read: 2.8175
- average number of users that have read a specific article 21.6181
