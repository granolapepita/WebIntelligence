I do not recommend to run the matlab code by yourself because for my PC it took approx. 30 minutes...

I included all information I found out so far in two structs -> item and user
They look like this:

item = 

              id: [1x2626 double]
          readBy: {1x2626 cell}
    numOfReaders: [1x2626 double]
    
user = 

                   id: [1x20854 double]
         articlesRead: {1x20854 cell}
    numOfArticlesRead: [1x20854 double]
    
so for example if you want to have a look at the first item:
        
        item.id(1) will give you the ID number,
        item.readBy(1) will give you a list of IDs from all users that have read item 1
        item.numOfReaders(1) will give you the number of users that have read item1
        
user example (I am not using user(1) as an example because the first entry belongs to all unrecognized users):

        user.id(2) will give you the ID number of the user
        user.articlesRead(2) will give you a list of IDs of all items that have been read by user 2
        user.numOfArticlesRead(2) will give you the number of items the user 2 has read
        
        
What I found out so far:

- 2626 item IDs 	-> only 69 with info about content
- 20854 user IDs
- very few articles that have been read outrageously much -> many articles that have only been read < 5 times
- average number of articles a user has read: 2.8175
- average number of users that have read a specific article 21.6181
- anarticle has in average bin read 3.142 times by the same user
- ca 35% of users have read the same articel more than once
